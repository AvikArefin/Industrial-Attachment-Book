The generator machine shown in Figure \ref{fig:generator} is the gas-powered generator J420 LEANDX, installed on the second floor of the energy building.

The generator offers an electrical output between 1,411 kW and 1,562 kW and a thermal output of 1,422 kW to 1,906 kW. Operating within a voltage range of 480V to 13.8kV, it achieves an electrical efficiency of up to 44.0\% and a thermal efficiency of up to 50.5\%. Such specifications make it well-suited to meet the high energy demands of the facility.
