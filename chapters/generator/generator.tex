Generators play a crucial role in the textile industry by providing a reliable source of power. They ensure that the production process is not interrupted due to power outages, which can be costly and time-consuming. The generator machine shown in Figure \ref{fig:generator} is typically used in small to medium-sized textile companies to maintain continuous operations.

The gas-powered generator J420 LEANDX, depicted in Figure \ref{fig:gas_gen}, is designed for larger textile manufacturing plants, such as one at which the industrial visit took place. It has a higher capacity and can support extensive machinery and equipment. This type of generator is essential for large-scale operations where the demand for power is significantly higher, ensuring that all processes run smoothly without any interruptions.
