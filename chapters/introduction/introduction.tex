Industrial attatchment serves like a vital connection between what students learn in class and actual work life. When talking bout the real world experience, students get placed in companies that match there field - this is especially important for engineering students who need hands-on practice. While working as trainees, these students get to learn from experienced professionals who show them the ins and outs of how companys work and what different employees do.
The process of choosing where students go depends on several things, such as whether the company is stable enough, if theres opportunities to do research, if the company culture fits well, and how good they are at training new people.

Students also develop professional skills - they get better at technical stuff, learn to communicate proper, figure out how to solve problems, and understand what standards the industry follows.
\subsection{Program Objectives}
The program tries to help students in different ways:
Students learn technical skills by working with new technology, seeing how things work in real life, and developing specific abilities they'll need. They also grow professionally by getting better at talking to people, working in teams, understanding how companies work, and developing good work habits.

\subsection{Significance of Industrial Training}
This training really helps students develop by:
Letting them use what they learned in school, develop technical skills, get better at solving problems, and understand real challenges. They also learn how workplaces function, meet people in the industry, understand industry standards, and improve there chances of getting good jobs. Students participate in company projects, come up with new solutions, help with ongoing research, and understand industry challenges. The program makes them more employable, helps them develop work skills, understand different career paths, and build connections in the industry.
This whole program makes sure students finish school knowing both the theory and practical parts of there field, so their ready to start working and contributing to whatever field they chose.
